    <h2><strong>What</strong> is it and <strong>Where</strong> does it come from?</h2>
    <hr>

    <p> <strong>Mountain tea</strong>  is a naturally caffeine-free <span class="herb">herbal</span> tea made from a single variety of the sideritis plant. 
      Also known as "Shepherd's Tea" or "Greek Mountain Tea," it is referred to in Greece as Tsai tou vounou, translating directly to "Tea of the mountain." 
      It is brewed using the dried flowers, leaves, and stems of the sideritis plant, found in the Mediterranean mountain regions of Greece,
       which is the largest consumer of mountain tea, as well as in Albania, Bulgaria, and Macedonia.
